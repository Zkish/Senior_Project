Project Description (Updated After Interviews)

The DIY Homeowners Do-It-All website is an all-in-one platform designed to help people plan and complete home renovation and repair projects with confidence. It combines smart estimation tools, professional-verified community support, and access to trusted local contractors—all in one place.

Core Features
1. Smart Project Cost Calculator (Improved Based on Interviews)

A guided tool that estimates:

* Total project cost (materials + optional contractor labor)

* Time required

* Materials list with quantities

Optional “common pitfalls” toggle to automatically include realistic overages (extra paint coats, material waste %, tool rental needs)

Monetization:
Recommendations link directly to partner sites like Amazon, Lowe’s, and Home Depot for affiliate revenue.

2. Verified Professional Forum

A community hub where users can:

* Ask questions and discuss projects

* View troubleshooting advice

* Learn from verified professionals (contractors, electricians, plumbers, etc.)

 * Search common issues and solutions from previous threads

Unlike Reddit-style forums, only approved professionals can post answers—giving users trustworthy guidance without conflicting amateur opinions.

3. Helper Finder – Local Contractor Recommendations

* A location-based directory that connects users with qualified professionals when a project becomes too complex, unsafe, or time-consuming to DIY.

Users can filter by:

* Project type (plumbing, flooring, electrical, painting, etc.)

* Availability

* Ratings and reviews

* Future integration allows contractors to respond directly to project requests.

4. User Accounts & Personal Dashboard

Every customer can create an account that allows them to:

* Save and revisit past project calculations

* Bookmark forum posts

* Track project progress

* Participate in discussions and Q&A

* Receive personalized material recommendations

* Get alerts about price trends or cost changes

This creates long-term engagement as users return for multiple home projects.

Overall Value of the Platform

The site helps DIY homeowners overcome the most common renovation struggles:

* Not knowing what a project should cost

* Fear of making mistakes

* Overwhelm from conflicting online information

* Needing reassurance or a second opinion

* Difficulty finding trustworthy contractors

By combining planning tools, professional advice, and local service options, the platform builds confidence and simplifies every step of the DIY process.
